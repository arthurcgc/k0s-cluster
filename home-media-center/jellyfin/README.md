# Installation

It is best if have a partioned outside disk dedicated to be a Persistent Volume for the node. This is not required but it is recommended.
Another option is to just use a dedicated folder on the node. This is not recommended but it is possible.
You have to edit the `pv.yaml` file to match your setup.
